<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Jerk is a style of cooking native to Jamaica, in which meat is dry-rubbed or wet marinated with a hot spice mixture called Jamaican jerk spice.
    Historians believe that jerking originated with the Amerindians in Jamaica from the Arawak and Ta√≠no tribes who intermingled with the Maroons.
    The smoky taste of jerked meat is achieved using various cooking methods, including modern wood-burning ovens. 
    The meat is normally chicken or pork, and the main ingredients of the spicy jerk marinade sauce are allspice and Scotch bonnet peppers. 
    Jerk cooking is popular in Caribbean and West Indian diaspora communities throughout North America and Western Europe.</p>
